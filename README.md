# DataViaSound
This is an application for Android which allows you to send data using sound waves. 
# Documentation
This application had been developed as part of my Engineer Diploma Work on Czestochowa University of Technology.
The diploma work can be treated as elaborated documentation of the application and the testing tool (DataViaSoundTester). It also contains related knowledge about sound, reports from tests which were performed over the application, analysis of the reports and conclusions.
